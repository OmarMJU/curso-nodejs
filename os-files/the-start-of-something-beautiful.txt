Always in my thoughts, you are
Always in my dreams, you are
I got your voice on tape
I got your spirit in a photograph
Always out of reach, you are
Cold inside my arms, you are
Simple like a child, you are
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the rain
Down inside my soul, you are
The more I show the way I feel the less I find that you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent
Forgot to mention we're good friends
I thought it was the start of something beautiful, well think again
Mother lost her looks for you
Father never wanted you
I trust in love and then I find that you never really felt the same
Something in your heart, so cruel
The more I show the way I feel the less I find that you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent
Forgot to mention we're good friends
I thought it was the start of something beautiful, well think again
The more I show the way I feel the less I find that you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent
Forgot to mention we're good friends
I thought it was the start of something beautiful, well think again
